# New-York-Taxi-Analysis
In this project, I will apply and demonstrate the data science pipeline to explore and use deterministic features to predict how much a cab driver can earn per hour in different areas of New York. Once we have the knowledge of which areas earn more and which areas earn less in any given day and any given hour. The union could distribute cab assignments more equitably across different areas, rotating cab drivers between higher and lower-income areas on a daily basis. This way, no one cab driver would dominate in a high-income area while another cab driver would be continuously evicted to a low-income area.
